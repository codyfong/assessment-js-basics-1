// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//1. Planning
//2. Analysis of Requirements
//3. Design
//4. Implementation
//5. Testing and Integration
//6. Mantain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Gather relevant information to develop software to expectations/specifications."
const design = "Use gathered information about requirements to begin prototyping, this step also helps decide programming language, security, etc."
const implementation = "This is the actual writing of the program by a developer/developers."
const testingAndIntegration = "Testing needs to be done before making software available to users. After the software is tested it can be deployed to users."
const mantain = "After the software is being used in the field, users may find bugs, which require maintenance. Future releases may also happen for other reasons, which is also part of maintenance."
